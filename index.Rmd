##  

- Close your eyes and imagine for a moment...
- Strolling through a field on a warm spring day, hand in hand with a loved one.
- It is quite possible that life does not get any better than this.
- What could possibly go wrong?

## 

- Who among us hasn't had a great walk spoiled by seeing an iris in a field and not knowing which species it was?
- This is made all the more frustrating by how easy it is to measure the sepal and petal length and width.
- Is there not anyone who can quantify the relationship between these variables and the species of iris?!?!
- Who will save our walks?!?!

## Introducing...Name That IRIS!!!

The idea is simple: utilize the famous Fisher/Anderson iris data set and a random forest model to turn the mystery of sepal and petal measurements into a classification of species.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(caret); data("iris")
set.seed(1234)
train_control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 3); rf.tunegrid <- data.frame(mtry = c(4))

model <- train(Species ~ ., data=iris, method="rf", trControl=train_control, tuneGrid = rf.tunegrid)
```

And the results are compelling, with a very high level of expected accuracy:

```{r, compare model results, echo=FALSE}
##Create the predictions on the training set
rf.pred <- predict(model, iris)

##Create a table comparing in-sample and out-of-sample accuracy
acc.table <- cbind(confusionMatrix(iris$Species, rf.pred)$overall["Accuracy"],
                   model$results[2])
row.names(acc.table) <- c("Random Forest")
colnames(acc.table) <- c("In-Sample Accuracy", "Est. Out-of-Sample Accuracy")

acc.table
```
